I am an assistant professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense focusing on AI Safety and Interpretability. Between 2022 and 2024, I have been working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, where I explored the very emergence of communication protocols between neural network agents. I defended my PhD on representation learning for texts and graphs in 2022 at Kiel University. I received my MSc degree in computer science from the same institution in 2017.
